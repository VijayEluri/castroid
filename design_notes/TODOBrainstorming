Ideas that came to me while using the application.

UI
1. Wait progress bar of some sort when downloading/parsing Podcast feed.
2. Sort order choice for items in an RSS feed.

URLs
1. Smarting DNS resolution of feed.  Currently fails if the http and www are missing.

Database:
1. Need to keep track of feeds seen/downloaded/download name. 
2. Prevent duplicate podcast URL's from being added to the database
3. Delete Feed option.
