Ideas that came to me while using the application.

UI
1. Wait progress bar of some sort when downloading/parsing Podcast feed.
2. Sort order choice for items in an RSS feed.
3. Filter for podcast list. e.g. only show 10 of the items, or only show unplayed items.

URLs
1. Smarter DNS resolution of feed.  Currently fails if the http and www are missing.

Database:
1. Need to keep track of feeds seen/downloaded/download name. 
2. Prevent duplicate podcast URL's from being added to the database
3. Delete Feed option. DONE
4. Worry about SQL injection attacks?
5. Update/Refresh stored podcasts.
